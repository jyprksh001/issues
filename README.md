# issues
Pull the code and hit the index.html file

#click the click me button
If you are  directly hitting the click me button without filling any data  it will fetch the user data of octocat/Hello-World repo
and if u are putting any other user data in input field in this format /repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/ then it will fetch you
datas of public repos of that user. Also the private repos implementation has not been done.
